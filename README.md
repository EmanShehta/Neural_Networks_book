# Neural_Networks_book
## The objective of this book is to break down an extremely complex topic, neural networks, into small pieces, consumable by anyone wishing to embark on this journey.Beyond breaking down this topic, the hope is to dramatically demystify neural networks. As you will soon see, this subject, when explored from scratch, can be an educational and engaging experience. This book is for anyone willing to put in the time to sit down and work through it. In return, you will gain a far deeper understanding than most when it comes to neural networks and deep learning.
